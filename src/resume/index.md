## Recommendations

---

### Linda Tvrdy, 2016 Civil Justice Fellow, Blue Ridge Labs @ Robin Hood Foundation {.h5 .primary .mb-2}

#### Worked directly with Devon at Blue Ridge Labs @ Robin Hood Foundation {.h6 .primary .mt-2}

Devon is a deep thinker who begins from a place of compassion. He meets people where they are, whether that person is a New Yorker City resident helping with user research or a legal academic without much tech experience. He unhesitatingly embraced the complexity of trying to improve access to justice for ordinary people. Without losing sight of that complexity, he designed elegant and practical tools, not to mention beautiful. In addition to being a first-rate designer, Devon also has “mad engineering skills,” to quote one of our teammates. In addition to his professional skill, Devon is the definition of a team player. He preserved team cohesion by keeping us focused on our goals, and he facilitated ideation sessions that brought out the best each of us had to offer. I cannot recommend him highly enough.

### Dane Vrabac, Founder and CEO, Quadrant.io {.h5 .primary .mb-2}

#### Managed Devon at Quadrant.io {.h6 .primary .mt-2}

Devon is both an exceptional designer and a front-end developer. He’s easy to work with and takes pride in everything he delivers. He’s flexible enough to work with either a fixed set of requirements or a rough idea and make it great.

### Joe Toohey, Principal of 2e Creative {.h5 .primary .mb-2}

#### Managed Devon at 2e Creative {.h6 .primary .mt-2}

Devon embodies the individual who is constantly pushing himself to new heights yet has his feet firmly planted in the realities of life and the business of doing intelligent creative. His willingness to tackle any challenge with commitment and dedication to excellence functions as a catalyst to propel any initiative he undertakes to a heightened level. I am confident that one day he will be viewed as a trend leader within the creative industry.
