#### Digital Product Designer {.h6 .primary .mt-0}

I contributed to the management and strategy of 11 products in our portfolio throughout their lifecycle. Beginning with identifying the needs of our product audiences and stakeholders, then market delivery, engagement measurement, and finally, maintenance and iteration on features to ensure impact, scale, and client satisfaction.

**Process Contributions**

* **Brand Identity Practice Development** – I audited and created guidelines for our product brand identities to help our team contextualize how residents interact with our products and illustrate how to develop new brands using the New York City brand identity.

* **User Experience (UX) Practice Development** – Led the assessment of our organization's internal user experience maturity using the Nielson Norman Group's UX Maturity model and worked towards more structured and effective practices. Organized our research materials, collection, and archival methods to facilitate regular in-person user testing to inform our products. Created a digital product feature development process incorporating user feedback into our existing data analytics collection practice resulting in a step-by-step framework for validating feature ideas. Piloted the use of Airtable as a Customer Relationship Manager (CRM) tool for outreach and maintaining contact with user research participants. On-boarded and mentored our first User Experience Design fellow, overseeing her work on several core initiatives for our product Working NYC, including a user research framework and workshop for our team to create usability heuristics.

* **Released and maintained 13+ open-source projects** – <a href="https://nycopportunity.github.io/loves-open-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Published code used by our products</a> and for the City of New York's civic technology community. Types of repositories include reusable web components, pattern library framework, WordPress framework and plugins, and Vue.js applications.

* **Mentor** – Our office offers a fellowship program for emerging designers, product managers, and engineers to gain experience working in local government. I had the opportunity to mentor 4 software engineering and 1 user experience fellow. All of whom moved on to full-time employment after their fellowships.

I implemented some required front-end changes to meet City IT requirements and worked with engineers to implement additional design recommendations.

* **Working NYC** – Designed the brand identity and developed the user interface for <a href="https://working.nyc.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">working.nyc.gov</a>, a workforce program guide aggregator.

I participated in the strategy, design, and development of several user research-backed features. These included customer feedback forms, a newsletter, and inclusive color themes. Led UX-focused workshops to facilitate the creation of user personas and usability heuristics. I filled in as manager for the product for 3 months while we backfilled the role, leading team stand-ups, coordinating with our primary agency partner, reporting site performance, and overseeing the completion of a significant job board feature.

* **Mental Health for All** – Designed and oversaw the engineering of <a href="https://mentalhealthforall.nyc.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">mentalhealthforall.nyc.gov</a>, New York City's free mental health services resource.
