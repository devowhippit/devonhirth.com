### Field Screener  {.h1 .my-6}

<!-- <figure class="figure">
  ACCESS NYC Field Screener
</figure> -->

In the summer of 2018, our team partnered with the Mayor's Public Engagement Unit to develop a version of the ACCESS NYC Eligibility Screener that their Outreach Specialists would use to screen New York City residents in person. These specialists go door-to-door to help residents with tenant support issues, managing cases in the field using tablets. This project's primary challenge was to optimize a 10 step benefit screener the specialists could use with their tablets in the short amount of time they have with New York City residents in the field. My role on this project was as lead developer.

We started the research process by shadowing the Outreach Specialists to get a sense of the challenges they encounter supporting tenants in the field. During this research, we discovered that the specialists usually have very little time to engage with tenants. Once we had finished our research and synthesis, we began designing and developing a minimum viable product throughout 4 development sprints. During each sprint, a design fellow would design the interface. Then, I would take the design and develop the functionality. Finally, we would conduct usability testing with specialists to gather feedback and iterate on the product.

The final design was a two-page screener with the original 10 steps compressed into collapsable sections. The specialists could more easily jump back and forth to fill these in through a more natural flow of conversation with tenants. I chose to build the screener using Vue.js to take advantage of the state, reactivity, and form validation Vue.js brings to front-end applications.
