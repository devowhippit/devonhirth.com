<h4 class="h5">Role: Digital Product Designer</h4>

During the summer of 2020, the Mayor's Office of Workforce Development partnered with our agency to create Working NYC, which helps New Yorkers prepare for and find a job through free job and adult education programs. My primary role on this product was to develop and manage the brand identity and lead the design strategy working closely with the product manager, content strategist, and lead engineer. Since the [initial launch](/portfolio/working-nyc/product-launch), I established a [feature development framework](/portfolio/working-nyc/feature-development-framework) that combined qualitative and quantitative feedback mechanisms to lead design research and feature development on the site. Using this framework has led to features informed by user-driven studies and data such as the newsletter, [jobs and opportunities content](/portfolio/working-nyc/jobs-and-opportunities-content-design), [inclusive color themes](/portfolio/working-nyc/inclusive-design-pattern-iteration), and the **website's structured job feature**.

> This work gave our small team a head start on the new administration's initiative to create a **singular resource for New York City talent**; for job-seekers and employers. {.content__full}

In 2022 we collaborated with the Mayor’s Office of Talent and Workforce Development, Deputy Mayor’s Office of Strategic initiatives, and The Office of Technology and Innovation to release the next major version of the site for job-seekers and employers. In the fall we launched the redesigned site, increasing the amount of program content from 30 to over 80 workforce programs. We added 8 population specific guides for youth/young adults, NYCHA residents, people with disabilities, black/hispanic/latino/indigenous people of color, justice-impacted individuals, and LGBTQ+, veterans, and women. At one point it featured over 200 structured job posts. The relaunch coincided with the launch of <a href="https://mycity.nyc.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">NYC MyCity</a> where Working NYC was featured as the primary workforce resource.

> In 2023, the site was renamed to <a href="https://jobready.nyc.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Job Ready NYC</a> and continues to to prepare and connect people living in New York City to jobs. {.content__full}

The projects below document my contributions prior to 2022 redesign and relaunch.
